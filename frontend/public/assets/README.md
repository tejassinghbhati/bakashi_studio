# Background Video

Please place your `Background.mp4` file in this directory.

The video will be used as an animated background for the Neural Style Transfer application.

## Requirements:
- File name: `Background.mp4`
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- The video will loop continuously and play muted in the background

## Alternative:
If you don't have a Background.mp4 file, the application will still work with the gradient background as a fallback.
